# Learning Targets

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Use _variables_ to make your code easier to read and maintain.
* Declare variables properly and understand that each variable has a
_data type_ (e.g., ```float, Vector3,``` or  ```GameObject```).
* _Initialize_ and _assign_ variables in C# code or in the inspector to set
or change their values.
* Use the appropriate _access modifiers_ (e.g., the ```public``` and ```private``` _keywords_) for your variables to make them  to changable in the Inspector.
